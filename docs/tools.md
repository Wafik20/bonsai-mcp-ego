# Tools reference

Bonsai MCP exposes sixteen tools, split into two categories:

| Category | Behaviour | Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **QUERY** | Read-only. Safe to call without confirmation. | `get_scene_info`, `get_selected_objects`, `list_elements`, `get_psets`, `get_viewport_screenshot`, `get_ifc_project_info`, `get_spatial_structure`, `get_quantities`, `plan_house_tour` |
| **EDIT** | Mutates Blender state, the IFC model, or the filesystem. | `execute_ifc_code`, `execute_blender_code`, `save_ifc_file`, `refresh_view`, `refresh_geometry`, `reload_project`, `generate_ego_video` |

The category is encoded in two places:

- A `[QUERY]` or `[EDIT]` prefix at the start of every tool description.
- The standard MCP `Tool.annotations` hints (`readOnlyHint`,
  `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`), which MCP clients
  can read to render the distinction natively.

Every tool also declares an `outputSchema` and returns
`structuredContent` alongside the human-readable JSON text, so clients
that understand structured tool output get typed results for free. Input
schemas are generated from the same Pydantic models the server validates
with, so schema and behaviour cannot drift apart.

List-shaped results are paged: pass `limit`/`offset` where offered and
watch the `total`/`truncated` flags instead of requesting everything at
once.

Errors follow one convention: every failure states what went wrong and
what to do next (for example, the read-only refusal names the exact
Blender panel toggle to flip, and an invalid `selector` query returns a
syntax cheat sheet). Clients and models should follow the instruction in
the error instead of retrying the same call.

Two code execution tools live in the EDIT category: `execute_ifc_code`
(preferred, IFC-only, `bpy` blocked) and `execute_blender_code` (full `bpy`
access). See [Safety](safety.md).

## `plan_house_tour` (QUERY)

Classifies all loaded IFC spaces, builds an evidenced interior connectivity graph,
and plans **one tour per connected interior component**. It never joins separate
units by teleportation. It does not modify IFC, Blender state, cameras, or files.
The tool works with **Allow edits** disabled. `generate_ego_video` reuses this
semantic tour as its route source.

Inputs (both optional):

```json
{"start_space_id": null, "seed": 0}
```

- `start_space_id`: positive IFC entity ID of an eligible space, not a GlobalId.
  It selects the start within its component; other components are still toured.
  Excluded, unknown, nonexistent, and non-space IDs produce an error.
- `seed`: integer from 0 to 2147483647. The same IFC, start, and seed produce
  the same result. Booleans, numeric strings, and unknown arguments are rejected.

### Classifications and targets

Every space has a classification, reason, and supporting evidence:

- `tourable_interior`: rooms to visit, including utility rooms.
- `circulation`: foyers, hallways, stair spaces, and similar connectors.
- `non_tourable`: excluded by supported metadata or a documented touring policy.
- `unknown`: insufficient or conflicting evidence; never silently excluded.

IFC function/classification metadata takes precedence over names. An INTERNAL
space flag alone does not establish occupancy. A conservative **service-roof
exclusion policy** may exclude a service-classified roof space with no evidenced
occupied use or access. That is a touring policy, not proof of physical
inaccessibility. Evidence of accessible or occupied roof use overrides it.

Results include `tourable_spaces`, `circulation_spaces`, `excluded_spaces`, and
`unresolved_spaces`, with reasons for every exclusion or unresolved classification.
`target_space_ids` identifies the coverage denominator: tourable rooms and the
circulation selected to connect them. Raw IFC spaces and graph diagnostics remain
available, including spaces not selected for touring.

### Connectivity and component tours

Door/opening relationships, paired virtual-boundary polygons, and actual
stair-tread/floor polygon overlaps supply edge evidence. Ambiguous door references
may be resolved by opposite-side containment in actual room volumes, a supported
opening prism, its host wall, and floor support. Unsupported or conflicting
geometry remains unresolved. Bounding-box proximity does not create edges.

Disconnected groups are investigated using component diagnostics. Supported unit
metadata, demising-wall evidence, hosted-opening audits, and distinct entrances
can support separate-unit status. Missing evidence remains an unresolved
disconnection rather than being declared a separate unit by default.

`tours` contains each component's ordered room steps, IDs, start, and coverage.
Rooms can be revisited. `components` and `component_details` describe the graph
and its validation; `raw_components` retains unfiltered component membership.
`graph_text` and `tour_text` provide readable debug output. The legacy flat `tour`
and `route_space_ids` are populated only for a single touring component; they are
empty when there are multiple components.

`coverage` is covered target spaces divided by all target spaces across the
component tours. `tourable_room_coverage` reports coverage of room targets alone.
A numeric coverage of 1.0 does **not** resolve classification or topology failures:
inspect `classification_complete`, `graph_validation_status`, `coverage_complete`,
`unresolved_spaces`, `unresolved_graph_spaces`, and component diagnostics as well.
Coverage is `null` when its denominator is empty; this is not successful coverage.
`whole_model_coverage` uses all IFC spaces as its denominator and is not the
interior-tour metric. Global reachability/visited counts cover the independent
component tours, not a continuous walk from one start. Explicit-start reachability
is reported separately when a start is supplied.

`blocking_unresolved_connectors` records unresolved links that affect validation.
`connector_audit_notes` retains non-blocking export issues, exterior doors, and
non-portals such as windows; these are not silently discarded.

This tool validates graph evidence, not door operation, collision-free walking
paths, stair camera motion, or physical passability. It does not render a video.

## `get_scene_info` (QUERY)

Returns a scene-level snapshot. When `query` is supplied, the response also
includes an `objects` array filtered by the query.

For structured element listings, prefer the dedicated
[`list_elements`](#list_elements-query) tool; the `query` parameter here
remains for compatibility.

Inputs (all optional):

```json
{
  "query": "walls",
  "ifc_class": null,
  "name": null,
  "global_id": null,
  "limit": 200,
  "offset": 0
}
```

Supported `query` values:

| Query | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| (omitted) | Scene summary only; no `objects` field. |
| `all` | All objects in the scene. |
| `selected` | Currently selected objects. |
| `walls`, `doors`, `windows`, `spaces`, `slabs`, `columns`, `beams`, `roofs`, `stairs` | Filtered by IFC class. |
| `by_class` | Requires `ifc_class`, e.g. `"IfcCovering"`. |
| `by_name` | Requires `name` (exact Blender object name). |
| `by_global_id` | Requires `global_id` (IFC GlobalId). |

Returns:

```json
{
  "scene_name": "Scene",
  "object_count": 42,
  "selected_count": 1,
  "selected_objects": ["IfcWall/MyWall"],
  "collections": ["IfcSite", "IfcBuilding"],
  "object_type_counts": {"MESH": 40, "EMPTY": 2},
  "ifc_available": true,
  "blender_version": "4.2.0",
  "objects": [
    {
      "name": "IfcWall/MyWall",
      "type": "MESH",
      "location": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
      "dimensions": [5.0, 0.2, 3.0],
      "ifc_class": "IfcWall",
      "global_id": "2O2Fr$t4X7Zf8NOew3FK6X"
    }
  ],
  "objects_total": 28,
  "objects_truncated": false,
  "objects_offset": 0,
  "objects_limit": 200
}
```

The `objects` field (and its paging metadata) is omitted entirely when no
`query` is supplied. On huge scenes, page with `limit`/`offset` instead of
raising the limit.

## `get_selected_objects` (QUERY)

Inputs (optional): `limit` (1-1000, default 200), because a box-select can
grab thousands of objects.

Returns:

```json
{
  "objects": [
    {
      "name": "IfcWall/MyWall",
      "type": "MESH",
      "location": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
      "dimensions": [5.0, 0.2, 3.0],
      "ifc_class": "IfcWall",
      "global_id": "2O2Fr$t4X7Zf8NOew3FK6X"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "truncated": false
}
```

`ifc_class` and `global_id` are `null` if no IFC data is associated.

## `list_elements` (QUERY)

Lists IFC-backed elements (objects without an IFC entity are skipped) with
structured filters, replacing most uses of `get_scene_info` queries.

Inputs (all optional):

```json
{
  "ifc_class": "IfcWall",
  "name_contains": "kitchen",
  "storey": "Level 1",
  "selector": "IfcWall, Pset_WallCommon.FireRating=F30",
  "limit": 200,
  "offset": 0
}
```

| Input | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `ifc_class` | Inheritance-aware: `IfcWall` also matches `IfcWallStandardCase`. |
| `name_contains` | Case-insensitive substring match on the Blender object name. |
| `storey` | Name or GlobalId of an `IfcBuildingStorey`. Elements inside the storey's spaces count as in the storey. |
| `selector` | Optional IfcOpenShell selector query, applied on top of the other filters. Examples: `IfcWall, material=concrete`, `IfcWall, Pset_WallCommon.FireRating=F30`, `IfcElement, Name=/W.*1/` (regex). Uses `ifcopenshell.util.selector` syntax; an invalid query returns an error with a short cheat sheet. |
| `limit` / `offset` | Paging, 1-1000 per page (default 200). |

Returns:

```json
{
  "elements": [
    {
      "name": "IfcWall/MyWall",
      "type": "MESH",
      "location": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
      "dimensions": [5.0, 0.2, 3.0],
      "ifc_class": "IfcWall",
      "global_id": "2O2Fr$t4X7Zf8NOew3FK6X"
    }
  ],
  "total": 28,
  "truncated": false,
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 200
}
```

## `get_spatial_structure` (QUERY)

Returns the project's spatial hierarchy as a tree: `IfcProject` ->
`IfcSite` -> `IfcBuilding` -> `IfcBuildingStorey` -> `IfcSpace`, with
storey elevations and (by default) counts of contained elements grouped by
IFC class. Answers "what is in this building, storey by storey" without
any code execution.

Inputs (optional): `include_element_counts` (default `true`).

Returns:

```json
{
  "schema": "IFC4",
  "tree": {
    "name": "My Project",
    "ifc_class": "IfcProject",
    "global_id": "0YvctVUKr0kugbFTf53O9L",
    "children": [
      {
        "name": "Site",
        "ifc_class": "IfcSite",
        "global_id": "...",
        "children": [
          {
            "name": "Building",
            "ifc_class": "IfcBuilding",
            "global_id": "...",
            "children": [
              {
                "name": "Level 1",
                "ifc_class": "IfcBuildingStorey",
                "global_id": "...",
                "elevation": 0.0,
                "element_counts": {"IfcDoor": 9, "IfcWall": 28},
                "element_total": 37,
                "children": [
                  {"name": "Kitchen", "ifc_class": "IfcSpace", "global_id": "..."}
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## `get_quantities` (QUERY)

Quantity takeoff without code execution: aggregates every numeric value
found in elements' IFC quantity sets (base quantities such as walls'
`NetSideArea` or slabs' `GrossVolume`), grouped by IFC class and
optionally per building storey.

Inputs (all optional):

```json
{
  "ifc_classes": ["IfcWall", "IfcSlab"],
  "by_storey": false
}
```

`ifc_classes` defaults to the common building element classes (walls,
slabs, columns, beams, doors, windows, roofs, stairs, coverings, spaces);
matching is inheritance-aware.

Returns:

```json
{
  "classes": {
    "IfcWall": {
      "count": 28,
      "elements_without_quantities": 2,
      "quantities": {
        "NetSideArea": {"sum": 412.6, "elements": 26},
        "Length": {"sum": 148.2, "elements": 26}
      }
    }
  },
  "units": {"LENGTHUNIT": "millimetre", "AREAUNIT": "square metre"},
  "by_storey": {
    "Level 1": {
      "IfcWall": {"count": 12, "quantities": {"NetSideArea": {"sum": 180.1, "elements": 12}}}
    }
  }
}
```

`elements_without_quantities` is a model-quality signal: elements of that
class carrying no numeric quantities at all. `units` is a best-effort read
of the project's unit assignment. `by_storey` appears only when requested.

## `get_psets` (QUERY)

Returns IFC property sets and quantity sets for one or more objects.
Accepts any mix of GlobalIds and Blender object names. Large batches are
paged: `limit` targets (default and maximum 100) are processed per call,
starting at `offset` (GlobalIds first, then names); the response reports
`targets_total`, `truncated`, and `next_offset` so clients can continue.

Inputs (at least one entry required between the two lists):

```json
{
  "global_ids": ["2O2Fr$t4X7Zf8NOew3FK6X"],
  "names": ["IfcWall/MyWall"],
  "limit": 100,
  "offset": 0
}
```

Returns an ordered `results` list that mirrors the input order
(GlobalIds first, then names). Each entry records the original
`request`, plus either the pset payload or an `error` field:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "request": {"global_id": "2O2Fr$t4X7Zf8NOew3FK6X"},
      "object": {
        "name": "IfcWall/MyWall",
        "global_id": "2O2Fr$t4X7Zf8NOew3FK6X",
        "ifc_class": "IfcWall"
      },
      "property_sets": {
        "Pset_WallCommon": {
          "IsExternal": true,
          "LoadBearing": false,
          "FireRating": "F30"
        }
      },
      "quantity_sets": {
        "Qto_WallBaseQuantities": {
          "Length": 5.0,
          "Height": 3.0,
          "NetArea": 14.5
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "request": {"name": "IfcDoor/Missing"},
      "error": "not found"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each `property_sets` / `quantity_sets` map passes through IfcOpenShell's native
`ifcopenshell.util.element.get_psets` shape, so besides the real property names
each set also carries an integer `id` key (the STEP id of the underlying
`IfcPropertySet` / `IfcElementQuantity`); clients can ignore it.

Returns a clear error if no IFC project is loaded. Per-target lookup
failures (missing GlobalId, missing object name, object without IFC link)
appear as `error` entries in the results list rather than aborting the
batch.

## `get_viewport_screenshot` (QUERY)

Captures the 3D viewport, optionally aiming and framing it first. The
render is downscaled so its longest edge fits `max_size` and encoded as
JPEG by default, keeping the response safely inside MCP size caps (some
clients enforce 1 MB per tool result). Scene render settings are restored
after the capture; the viewport orientation persists.

Inputs (all optional):

```json
{
  "max_size": 800,
  "format": "jpeg",
  "quality": 85,
  "view": "iso",
  "fit": "all",
  "azimuth": null,
  "elevation": null,
  "storey": null,
  "shading": null,
  "show_overlays": false,
  "include_objects": false,
  "max_objects": 50
}
```

| Input | Values | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_size` | 64-2048, default 800 | Longest edge in px. Downscales only, never upscales, and is additionally capped by the native viewport resolution. |
| `format` | `jpeg` (default), `png` | JPEG is much smaller; PNG is lossless. A PNG that is estimated to exceed the response size cap is auto-downgraded to JPEG *before* rendering, with a note in the response. |
| `quality` | 1-100, default 85 | JPEG only. |
| `view` | `top`, `bottom`, `front`, `back`, `left`, `right`, `iso`, `camera` | Aims the viewport first. Axis names give orthographic views, `iso` a perspective isometric, `camera` the scene camera. Omit to keep the current orientation. |
| `azimuth` / `elevation` | degrees | Arbitrary view direction instead of `view` (mutually exclusive with it). Azimuth 0 = front, counter-clockwise seen from above; elevation 0 = horizontal, 90 = bird's eye (defaults to 30 when only azimuth is given). `iso` equals azimuth 45, elevation 30. |
| `fit` | `all`, `selected` | Frames everything or the current selection. Framing is direction-aware: after the initial fit, the zoom is tightened to the content's projected 2D extent, so elevations fill the frame instead of the bounding sphere. |
| `storey` | storey Name or GlobalId | Isolates one `IfcBuildingStorey` for the shot: everything else is hidden and restored afterwards. `storey` + `view='top'` + `fit='all'` is a floor plan. |
| `shading` | `wireframe`, `solid`, `material`, `rendered`, `class_colors` | Viewport shading for the capture (restored afterwards). `class_colors` renders solid with one flat color per IFC class and returns a legend. |
| `show_overlays` | boolean, default false | Overlays (grid, axes, gizmos) are hidden by default; they are noise for image analysis. Set true to keep them. |
| `include_objects` | boolean, default false | Adds screen-space 2D bounding boxes and view depth keyed by GlobalId to the text output. |
| `max_objects` | 1-200, default 50 | Cap for `include_objects`. Selection is stratified across IFC classes (a few walls, doors, windows, ...) so ground slabs cannot crowd out everything else; truncation is flagged. |

Returns, in order:

1. An MCP **image content block** (`image/jpeg` or `image/png`). The image
   comes first because some MCP clients mishandle mixed content.
2. A **text block** with the image dimensions and attached base64 length
   (so a client-side image drop is diagnosable from text), any
   auto-downgrade note, the `class_colors` legend when requested, and
   structured **viewport state**: rotation quaternion, perspective mode
   (`PERSP`/`ORTHO`/`CAMERA`), `is_orthographic_side_view`, view distance,
   pivot location, and (when used) the applied `azimuth`/`elevation` and
   `storey`.

With `include_objects=true`, the viewport state also lists in-frame objects:

```json
{
  "objects_in_view": [
    {
      "name": "IfcWall/MyWall",
      "ifc_class": "IfcWall",
      "global_id": "2O2Fr$t4X7Zf8NOew3FK6X",
      "box": [0.329, 0.55, 0.712, 0.563],
      "depth": 24.6
    }
  ],
  "objects_in_view_total": 1250,
  "objects_truncated": true
}
```

`box` is `[x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]`, normalized 0-1 with the origin at
the image's top-left (smaller `y` is higher on screen). `depth` is the
view-space distance to the object's bounding-box centre in model units, so
near/far ordering is available from text alone. Boxes are approximate
(full object extent, ignoring occlusion) but preserve relative spatial
layout, which lets a text-only agent reason about containment,
left/right/above/below relations, relative sizes, and depth ordering even
when its client does not deliver tool-result images.

If Blender is running in `--background` mode or has no open 3D viewport,
the tool returns a clear error (a visible `VIEW_3D` area is required).
When several 3D viewports are open, the largest one is used.

## `get_ifc_project_info` (QUERY)

Inputs: none.

Returns:

```json
{
  "schema": "IFC4",
  "project_name": "My Project",
  "project_global_id": "0YvctVUKr0kugbFTf53O9L",
  "entity_counts": {
    "IfcSite": 1,
    "IfcBuilding": 1,
    "IfcBuildingStorey": 3,
    "IfcWall": 28,
    "IfcDoor": 9,
    "IfcWindow": 14,
    "IfcSlab": 6,
    "IfcSpace": 22,
    "IfcColumn": 0,
    "IfcBeam": 0,
    "IfcRoof": 0,
    "IfcStair": 0
  },
  "materials": {
    "count": 14,
    "names": ["Concrete", "Glass", "Steel", "Timber"],
    "truncated": false
  },
  "classifications": {
    "count": 1,
    "systems": [
      {"name": "Uniclass 2015", "source": "NBS", "edition": "v1.20"}
    ],
    "truncated": false
  }
}
```

`materials.names` is sorted and de-duplicated; `materials.count` is the raw
`IfcMaterial` count. Both lists are capped at 100 entries; `truncated: true`
means more entities exist than were returned.

If no IFC project is loaded, returns a clear error.

## `execute_ifc_code` (EDIT)

**Preferred code execution tool.** Runs IfcOpenShell / Bonsai API code with
`bpy` access blocked. Use this for all IFC/BIM data operations.

Pre-injected namespace (no imports needed):

| Variable | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `ifc` | The currently loaded IFC file (`ifcopenshell.file` or `None`) |
| `ifcopenshell` | The `ifcopenshell` module |
| `ifc_api` | `ifcopenshell.api` (high-level create/edit operations) |
| `element_util` | `ifcopenshell.util.element` (psets, qtos, traversal) |
| `tool` | `bonsai.tool` module (or `None` if unavailable) |
| `get_ifc_file()` | Returns the loaded IFC file, raising a clear error if none is open |
| `get_default_container()` | Returns the active spatial container (e.g. the active storey) |
| `save_and_load_ifc(path=None)` | Legacy helper (save then full reload); prefer the refresh tools |

**Viewport sync:** edits made here change the in-memory IFC model but do
*not* appear in the Blender viewport until refreshed. Pick the cheapest
tier for what the edit touched: [`refresh_view`](#refresh_view-edit) after
data-only edits (names, psets, classifications),
[`refresh_geometry`](#refresh_geometry-edit) after moving elements or
changing representations, [`reload_project`](#reload_project-edit) after
creating or deleting elements. Do not save just to make edits visible;
saving is a separate, durability-only step.

MCP edits are outside Blender's undo stack: Ctrl+Z will not revert them.

Inputs:

```json
{ "code": "walls = ifc.by_type('IfcWall')\nfor w in walls:\n    print(w.Name, w.GlobalId)" }
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "stdout": "MyWall 2O2Fr$t4X7Zf8NOew3FK6X\n",
  "stderr": "",
  "stdout_truncated": false,
  "stderr_truncated": false,
  "stdout_bytes": 38,
  "stderr_bytes": 0,
  "error": null,
  "traceback": null,
  "ifc_available": true,
  "namespace_keys": ["ifc", "ifcopenshell", "ifc_api", "element_util", "tool",
                     "get_ifc_file", "get_default_container", "save_and_load_ifc"]
}
```

If the code contains `bpy` imports or references, the tool returns an error
directing you to use `execute_blender_code` instead.

## `execute_blender_code` (EDIT)

Fallback for operations that genuinely require `bpy` (viewport manipulation,
rendering, object transforms, modifiers). **For IFC/BIM data work, always
prefer `execute_ifc_code`.**

The same three helper functions as `execute_ifc_code` are pre-injected:
`get_ifc_file()`, `get_default_container()`, and `save_and_load_ifc(path=None)`.

Inputs:

```json
{ "code": "import bpy; print(len(bpy.context.scene.objects))" }
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "stdout": "42\n",
  "stderr": "",
  "stdout_truncated": false,
  "stderr_truncated": false,
  "stdout_bytes": 3,
  "stderr_bytes": 0,
  "error": null,
  "traceback": null
}
```

Errors are reported with `success: false`, a stringified `error`, and the full
traceback.

`stdout`/`stderr` are each capped at 256 KB to keep one MCP message bounded;
when truncation occurs, the corresponding `_truncated` flag is `true` and
`_bytes` reports the original size before trimming.

## `refresh_view` (EDIT)

Syncs the Blender scene after **data-only** IFC edits: names, descriptions,
psets, quantities, classifications. Sub-millisecond per element even on
million-entity models. Does not write to disk. Does not rebuild geometry.

Inputs:

```json
{ "global_ids": ["2O2Fr$t4X7Zf8NOew3FK6X"] }
```

Returns per-element results (`refreshed` counts successes; elements that
were deleted or have no Blender object yet get an `error` entry pointing at
`reload_project`):

```json
{
  "refreshed": 1,

## `refresh_geometry` (EDIT)

Rebuilds Blender geometry and placement for **specific** elements after
geometric IFC edits: moved elements (changed `ObjectPlacement`) or changed
representations. Fast and targeted; does not write to disk; the rest of
the scene (selection, visibility, camera) is untouched.

Not covered: newly created and deleted elements; use
[`reload_project`](#reload_project-edit) for those.

Inputs:

```json
{ "global_ids": ["2O2Fr$t4X7Zf8NOew3FK6X"] }
```

Returns per-element results with `placement_synced` flags and a
`representations_reloaded` summary flag.

## `reload_project` (EDIT)

Full scene rebuild from the **in-memory** IFC model. The model is written
to a temporary file and reloaded from it; the project file on disk is not
modified, and the project path is restored afterwards so saving (Ctrl+S or
`save_ifc_file`) still targets the user's file.

**Slow**: seconds to minutes on large models, and it resets selection,
visibility, and camera. Use only when targeted refresh is insufficient:
after creating or deleting elements, or when the scene has genuinely
diverged.

Takes no inputs. Returns:

```json
{ "reloaded": true, "project_path": "C:/models/house.ifc", "path_restored": true }
```

## `save_ifc_file` (EDIT)

Writes the IFC model to disk. **Durability only**: call it when the user
asks to save. It does not refresh the viewport; use the refresh tools for
visibility. The user pressing Ctrl+S in Blender is equivalent to the
in-place mode.

Inputs (all optional):

```json
{ "output_path": "/abs/path/to/output.ifc", "overwrite": false, "reload": false }
```

Two modes:

- **In-place save** (`output_path` omitted): saves the project back to its
  own file, like Bonsai's File > Save IFC. There is no overwrite guard here,
  since writing the project's own file is the point. Fails with a clear error if the project
  has never been saved (no path yet).
- **Save-as** (`output_path` given): writes to the new path. Refuses to
  overwrite an existing file unless `overwrite=true`; the parent directory
  must already exist. The project keeps pointing at its original file.

`reload=true` is a legacy flag that reloads the project from the saved file
afterwards; prefer `reload_project`, which does not require saving first.

Returns:

```json
{
  "saved": true,
  "output_path": "/abs/path/to/output.ifc",
  "in_place": false,
  "method": "bonsai.bim.export_ifc.IfcExporter",
  "reloaded": false
}
```

`method` reports which writer ran: `"bonsai.bim.export_ifc.IfcExporter"`
(preferred; Bonsai's exporter first syncs pending Blender-side edits into
the IFC model) or `"ifcopenshell.write"` (fallback when Bonsai is not
available).

## Resources and prompts

Beyond tools, the server exposes read-only state as MCP **resources**
(clients can pin them into context without a tool round trip):

| URI | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `bonsai://project` | The `get_ifc_project_info` payload. |
| `bonsai://scene` | The scene summary (no object query). |
| `bonsai://element/{global_id}/psets` | Resource template: psets/qtos for one element. |

All resources return `application/json`.

Two MCP **prompts** encode the workflows the server instructions describe
in prose:

| Prompt | Arguments | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model-audit` | `focus` (optional) | Walk the model with the query tools (project info, spatial tree, quantities, pset spot-checks, screenshots) and produce a quality report. |
| `visual-verify` | `what_changed` (optional) | Reload if needed, take overview and detail screenshots, compare against the intended edit. |

Long operations also emit coarse MCP progress notifications when the
client supplies a `progressToken`.


## `generate_ego_video` [EDIT]

Render a first-person walkthrough of the currently loaded IFC scene. Requires
**Allow edits** in the bridge. Writes an MP4 and a camera-pose JSON sidecar on
the **Blender host**, not the MCP client. No video bytes are sent over MCP.

```json
{
  "output_path": "/absolute/path/walkthrough.mp4",
  "duration_seconds": 30,
  "fps": 10,
  "width": 1280,
  "height": 720,
  "camera_height": 1.65,
  "seed": 0,
  "component_id": null
}
```

Only `output_path` is required. The example shows all defaults.

| Argument | Bounds |
| --- | --- |
| `output_path` | Nonempty string ending in `.mp4`; no NUL characters |
| `duration_seconds` | Finite number greater than 0, at most 3600 |
| `fps` | Integer, 1–60 |
| `width`, `height` | Even integers, 64–4096 |
| `camera_height` | Finite eye height in metres, greater than 0, at most 10 |
| `seed` | Integer, 0–2147483647 |
| `component_id` | Nonnegative integer or null; null selects a deterministic eligible component |

Numeric strings, booleans, unknown arguments, and nonfinite numbers are rejected.
`duration_seconds` is a minimum, not a route cutoff. The complete tour takes
priority; walking, turns, and room observations can extend the video.
The returned duration is the actual `frame_count / fps`.

The structured result includes `success`, `video_path`, `poses_path`,
`frame_count`, `fps`, `duration_seconds`, `requested_duration_seconds`, `width`,
`height`, `camera_height`, `seed`, and `navigation` metadata. It also reports
`coordinate_system`, `position_units`, `metres_per_scene_unit`, and
`quaternion_order`. Tour metadata includes `component_id`, ordered `tour` space
IDs (including revisits), `visited_spaces`, `tourable_rooms_visited`,
`tourable_rooms_total`, `coverage`, and `route_length_m`.

For `walkthrough.mp4`, the sidecar is `walkthrough_poses.json`. It contains the
same metadata plus a `frames` array. Each entry has zero-based `frame`, one-based
`blender_frame`, `timestamp` in seconds, `position` as `[x, y, z]`, and
`rotation_quaternion` as `[w, x, y, z]`. Positions use Blender world scene units;
`metres_per_scene_unit` converts them to metres. The world is right-handed and
Z-up. Camera forward is local -Z and camera up is local +Y. Poses are sampled
from the evaluated camera at the exact rendered frames. `space_id` identifies
the containing IFC space where membership is reliable; portal gaps can be null.

Navigation reports `door_collision_policy: "IfcDoor_ignored"`. Door relationships
still establish connectivity, but physical `IfcDoor` objects are excluded from
navigation and hidden during rendering. There are no door actions or animations.

The output parent directory must already exist. Existing video or sidecar files
are never overwritten. Use a new filename for another run. Paths refer to files
on the Blender host; Blender-relative `//` paths are also accepted.

### Live progress in PowerShell

When Blender starts a validated run, it creates an atomic JSON snapshot beside
the video: `walkthrough.mp4` uses `walkthrough_progress.json`. In a **separate terminal**
on the Blender host, run the watcher while making the usual `generate_ego_video`
call. The watcher does not start or cancel a render:

```powershell
.\scripts\watch_ego_progress.ps1 -Path 'D:\renders\walkthrough_progress.json'
```

Requires Windows PowerShell 5.1 or newer; no dependencies. Optional
`-PollMilliseconds 500` sets the refresh interval. `-WaitSeconds 120` limits
waiting for the file to appear (or become readable again). Use a unique output
filename for each run: the progress sidecar also cannot overwrite a previous run.

The native progress bar shows the current stage, message, elapsed time, stage
counters, and details such as component, spaces, connector, route, search attempt,
expanded nodes, frontier size, or frames. Percentages apply only to a stage with
known `completed` and `total` counts; unknown-size searches are indeterminate.
The last-update age keeps increasing without new snapshots, so you can spot stale
progress; it does not by itself prove that Blender has stopped. Completion clears
the bar and exits 0. Failure prints the message, clears the bar, and exits 1.

The JSON contains `status` (`running`, `completed`, or `failed`), `stage`,
`message`, nullable `completed` and `total`, `elapsed_seconds`, UTC ISO
`updated_at`, and a stage-dependent `details` object. The final snapshot remains
available after the run.

### Rendering and navigation limits

- Uses Workbench studio/material-color rendering, not a photorealistic material
  render. Requires native FFmpeg MPEG4/H.264 support. No audio is generated.
- Requires a loaded IFC and static source geometry. Existing animated objects/data,
  simulated or Geometry Nodes geometry, external frame-change handlers, and
  differing viewport/render modifier visibility are rejected for navigation
  geometry. Physical `IfcDoor` objects are ignored before these checks.
- Reuses `plan_house_tour` connectivity and preserves the selected component
  tour, including revisits. Each transition is constrained to its evidenced
  door, opening, or stair. Disconnected components are never joined.
- Tourable rooms require interior observation points. Each leg prefers a simple
  observation-point -> evidenced connector -> observation-point path. Room-volume
  and point-camera wall tests prevent arbitrary shortcuts; local routing is used
  for concave rooms and stairs. Furniture and nearby geometry are not blockers.
  Missing connector geometry still fails rather than silently skipping a room.
- All physical `IfcDoor` geometry, including frame geometry owned by that
  entity, is ignored. Door objects are hidden only for rendering, with visibility
  restored afterward. Walls and doorway openings remain intact; every transition
  must still cross its evidenced portal. Door meshes and the source IFC are never
  modified. No door-motion fallback or camera-radius retry is used.
- No capsule/body collision or 0.30 m clearance requirement is applied. This is
  a plausible point-camera tour, not certified collision-free human navigation.
  Existing stair tread heights and continuous step interpolation are retained.
  The camera pauses at turns; heading changes are limited to 60 degrees per second.
- Navigation records `method: "semantic_connector_guided_tour"`,
  `collision_policy: "point_camera_walls_only"`, and per-transition frame ranges.
  Evaluated geometry above 250,000 triangles is rejected. Check the video and
  `navigation` metadata before using it as training data.
- Temporary camera objects, render settings, frame state, and visibility changes
  are restored after success or failure. The IFC model is not saved or edited.
  Incomplete output files created by the command are removed on failure.

Rendering is synchronous and can keep Blender busy for a long time. This command
has a 3600-second bridge reply timeout; other tools keep their normal timeout.
The MCP client may also need a longer tool-call timeout. A timeout does not prove
that rendering stopped. Check Blender before retrying to avoid duplicate work.
Missing geometry, failed path planning, invalid output locations, and render
failures are reported as tool errors, not successful video results.
